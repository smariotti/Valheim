# Killcam

Attaches a picture-in-picture camera to every arrow, bolt, or spear you throw/shoot.
While the projectile is in flight a small inset viewport appears below the minimap in the
top-right corner, showing the "bullet's-eye" view with the shaft visible at the bottom of the
frame. The PiP disappears the moment the projectile lands or is destroyed.
