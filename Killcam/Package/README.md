# ArrowCam

Attaches a picture-in-picture camera to every arrow, bolt, or spear you throw/shoot.
While the projectile is in flight a small inset viewport appears below the minimap in the
top-right corner, showing the "bullet's-eye" view with the shaft visible at the bottom of the
frame. The PiP disappears the moment the projectile lands or is destroyed.

Here's what it looks like by default, under the minimap:
